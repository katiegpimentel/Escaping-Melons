	<p>You are a watermelon trying to escape the room the cantaloupes have locked you in. The cantaloupes hate you and your kind because you're the superior melon and humans love you. Especially you. You're respected in your community because you are huge and have a unique shape. Get the watermelon out of the room, so you can help fight the cantaloupes that have taken over Watermelon Willow City. </p>
